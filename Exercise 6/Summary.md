Aim: Classification using Neural network models

Objectives:
  Perform classification on bitcoin 2011 dataset
  Select correct architecture for +75% accuracy on cross validation and test set for bitcoin 2011 dataset - 60%-20%-20% (Train-Crossval-Test split)
  Plot accuracy vs validation acc and loss vs validation loss during epochs
